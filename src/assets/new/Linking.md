tags: [[test-tag]] [[tag]] [[linking]]
Here we see that a tag can be used to link pages.
We have learned from [[Tag description]] that each page idealy contains an individual thought. From [[Tag use]] we know that we can show linked thoughts using tags.

```markdown
[[tag (file name of linked file) | tag name ]]
```

Perhaps we can take this further by exploring the implications of having links. [[Representing tags as nodes]]

Here we have learned that we can connect individual related thoughts. building nodes, building knowledgebase . 

## Converge knowledge
Make summaries of individual thoughts and link main notes to Generated index in a central tag ( tag with high convergence )
[[Our desired implementation]]
